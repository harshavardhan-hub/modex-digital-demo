              <h2 className="heading-3 mb-4">4. Payment Terms</h2>
              <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-6">
                Payment terms will be specified in individual project agreements. Generally, 
                we require milestone-based payments: 30% upfront, 40% at mid-point, and 30% 
                upon completion. All payments are non-refundable unless otherwise specified 
                in writing.
              </p>

              <h2 className="heading-3 mb-4">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
              <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-6">
                Upon full payment, clients receive ownership of the final deliverables. 
                However, Modex Digital retains the right to use project work in portfolios 
                and marketing materials unless otherwise agreed. We retain ownership of all 
                pre-existing intellectual property and methodologies.
              </p>

              <h2 className="heading-3 mb-4">6. Project Timeline</h2>
              <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-6">
                While we strive to meet all agreed-upon deadlines, timelines are estimates 
                and may be affected by factors beyond our control. Delays caused by client 
                feedback cycles, content provision, or scope changes may extend delivery dates.
              </p>

              <h2 className="heading-3 mb-4">7. Revisions and Changes</h2>
              <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-6">
                Each project includes a specified number of revision rounds as outlined in 
                the project agreement. Additional revisions or scope changes may incur 
                additional charges.
              </p>
